Population analysis of *pf*MSP1 in Malaria
================

## Background

Extensive antigenic variability of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites is
known to cause dysregulation of the host immunity during infection and
this has been an underlying challenge for antigens that may be
clinically protective for vaccine development. Characterizing
polymorphism patterns for these antigens in malaria endemic regions will
help in further understanding the host-parasite immune interaction.
Properties of MSP1 gene from parasite DNA from 33 children with multiple
infection was characterised

## Analysis

-   *Population haplotype analysis* MSP1 sequences were grouped to
    haplotype clusters. Frequencies of the haplotypes in the population
    was then determined

-   *Temporal haplotype trends*  
    Followed through infection episodes at population level to see how
    frequent haplotypes change with time

-   *Linkage disequillibrium analysis*  
    Done seperately in DnaSP

-   *Phylogenetic population clustering* Haplotypes were plotted as
    phylogenetic trees and clustered in heatmaply to define group
    relationship between haplotypes
