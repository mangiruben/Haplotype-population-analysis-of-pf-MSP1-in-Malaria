## Background

Extensive antigenic variability of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites is
known to cause dysregulation of the host immunity during infection and
this has been an underlying challenge for antigens that may be
clinically protective for vaccine development. Characterizing
polymorphism patterns for these antigens in malaria endemic regions will
help in further understanding the host-parasite immune interaction.

## Analysis

- *Population haplotype analysis* Sequences are grouped to Haplotypes
  based on cladistic relationship and frequencies of the haplotypes
  determined using phyclust package (*Tzeng 2005*)

- *Temporal haplotype trend*  
  Followed through infection episodes at population level to see how
  four frequent haplotypes change with time

- *Linkage Disequilibrium* Analysis done using DnaSP

- *Phylogenetic population clustering* Haplotypes were ploted using
  phylogenetic tree by applying hamming pairwise distance matrix for
  corresponding residues between two sequences of equal lengths.
