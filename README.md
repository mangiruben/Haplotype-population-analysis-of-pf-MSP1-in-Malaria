## Background

Extensive antigenic variability of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites is
known to cause dysregulation of the host immunity during infection and
this has been an underlying challenge for antigens that may be
clinically protective for vaccine development. Characterizing
polymorphism patterns for these antigens in malaria endemic regions will
help in further understanding the host-parasite immune interaction.

## Analysis

-   *Population haplotype analysis*
-   *Temporal Haplotype density*  
    Following individuals through infection episodes and at population
    level to see how haplotypes change with time and detect the
    prevalent haplotype with time)
-   *Phylogenetic population clustering* How many clusters, Discuss the
    cluster. Which cluster is common
-   *Motif analysis*, what different motif appear with haplotype and
    what implication may it have in invasion
